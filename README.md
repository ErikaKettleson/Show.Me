Show.Me is an interactive web app leveraging a custom built data set of the most popular colors over the last ten seasons of runway shows. Working with about 20,000 images from thirty designer brands, each show was processed, sampled & analyzed using k-means clustering and Pillow, and the top ten colors pulled out for visualization. Charts examine color use by year, season, brand and by overall individual popularity by frequency.
